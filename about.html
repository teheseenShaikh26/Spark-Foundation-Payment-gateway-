            <p>Giving to charity or the nonprofit organization is not a business transaction.
                It is a connection with the humans and the world. 
                Many organizations are working to attract the donors to give.
                 They have to work on different platforms and show the donors how their money is invested in a better way.
                  The charitable donations help us to have an effective appeal.
                  It is important that you reach out to the charity and listen to their stories. 
                  They will create an inspiration for you to donate. 
                  Here we have everything you need to know about such organizations before you donate to charity.</p>
